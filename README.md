# GeneEM
This is a project to evaluate Embedding Method for task that discovery gene!
# first 
You need install BioNEV
# second
you need input youself disease seed gene(some gene list, it must be csv file) to the input dir  
you can get the seed list form autoseed, opentarget and pubmed

Of course, you can use yourself ppi network replace ours, you replace the ppi.csv path in the process.ipynb 
### action: the csv filename is the disease name
# finally
run the process.ipynb cell you can get a eval and result dir  
the eval dir is save the evalution about different embedding method  
the result dir is save the predict result from different embedding method
